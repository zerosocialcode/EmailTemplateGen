## Getting Started

### 1. Install Requirements

Before using TemplateFusion, ensure you have all dependencies installed.  
Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The project requires Python 3.7 or higher and Flask for web-based generators.

---

### 2. Configure MailBird for Sending Emails

To use the MailBird module for sending emails, you must first configure your sender email account:

1. **Open `MailBird/main.py` in a text editor.**
2. **Add your Gmail address and an app password** (not your regular Gmail password) as instructed in the script.  
   - **App passwords** are special 16-character codes generated by Google for connecting third-party applications securely.

#### How to Get a Gmail App Password

1. Go to your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if you haven't already.
3. After enabling 2-Step Verification, go to the **App passwords** section.
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" or your device as the device, then click "Generate".
5. Copy the 16-character app password shown and paste it into the appropriate field in `MailBird/main.py`.

> **Never use your regular Gmail password in third-party scripts. Always use an app password for enhanced security.**

---

### 3. Launch the Main Controller

From the root directory, start the main controller script:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### 4. Select a Module

- The main controller will automatically detect and list all available modules, such as EmailGeneratorV1, EmailGeneratorV2, and MailBird.
- Follow the prompt to select which module you want to use.

---

### 5. Follow Module Instructions

- **Template Generators:**  
  You will be guided to a web interface to create your custom email template. Fill out the form and generate your template as needed.

- **MailBird:**  
  Select an email template from the `MailBird/mails/` directory and provide recipient details to send your email.

#### Example Email Sending Workflow

1. Start `main.py` and select EmailGeneratorV2.
2. Use the web interface to design and download your HTML email template.
3. Move the generated template to `MailBird/mails/`.
4. Open `MailBird/main.py`, set your Gmail and app password.
5. Restart `main.py`, select MailBird, and follow prompts to send your email.

## Customization

  Place HTML files in `EmailGeneratorV2/templates/email_templates/` to expand your template library.
